# Robot Historical Inspection Semantics

This document defines bounded as-of inspection and incident-replay semantics for ntm robot mode surfaces.

## Overview

Operators and agents need to answer historical questions: "What did ntm believe when this incident opened?" or "What did this section look like 10 minutes ago?" This contract defines how ntm supports bounded historical inspection without becoming a full analytics warehouse.

## Design Principles

1. **Operator-focused**: Support debugging and post-mortem, not analytics
2. **Bounded scope**: Recent history only, not arbitrary time ranges
3. **Incident-centric**: Incidents are primary replay anchors
4. **Confidence-aware**: Always report staleness and completeness
5. **On-demand**: Reconstruct when needed, cache when efficient

## Historical Query Types

### Historical Surface Separation

Historical inspection is a distinct contract from live snapshot and raw event replay.

| Surface | Purpose | Returns | Must Not Be Confused With |
|---------|---------|---------|----------------------------|
| Live snapshot/status | Current operator state | Best current projection | Historical reconstruction |
| `inspect` + `as_of` | Point-in-time state | Reconstructed section state no newer than requested time | Live snapshot |
| `incident_replay` | Incident archaeology | Boundary state + bounded surrounding context | Generic event search |
| Bounded `range` query | Short recent timeline | Ordered recent events and bounded supporting context | Unbounded analytics |
| Raw `events` replay | Transport/event debugging | Event stream, not projected state | As-of inspection |

Normative rules:
1. Historical state MUST be requested explicitly with `as_of`, `incident_replay`, or a bounded `range`.
2. Live surfaces MUST ignore historical parameters rather than silently changing meaning.
3. Event replay returns ordered events; it does not itself guarantee a reconstructed section view.
4. Historical inspection is for recent operational debugging only and MUST NOT imply warehouse-style analytics support.

### As-Of Queries

Request state at a specific recent timestamp:

```json
{
  "action": "inspect",
  "request_id": "req_20260322040000_x7k",
  "as_of": {
    "type": "timestamp",
    "value": "2026-03-22T03:50:00Z"
  },
  "sections": ["quota", "alerts", "agents"]
}
```

#### As-Of Resolution Semantics

An as-of response answers: "What is the most recent retained state ntm can justify at or before this timestamp?"

Normative rules:
1. Section state MUST be selected from the latest retained observation whose effective time is less than or equal to the requested timestamp.
2. Reconstruction MUST NOT pull section content from after the requested timestamp unless that future-derived content is explicitly marked as interpolation in degraded metadata.
3. If an exact retained snapshot exists at the requested timestamp, the response SHOULD use it directly and report `reconstruction.method = "snapshot"`.
4. If no exact snapshot exists, ntm MAY replay from the nearest earlier retained baseline or watermark and MUST report the reconstruction method it used.
5. If no retained baseline exists at or before the requested timestamp for a requested section, the response MUST explain that section as unavailable rather than inventing a value.
6. When different sections resolve from different retained times, each section's staleness or completeness metadata MUST make that skew visible.

#### Reconstruction Modes

Historical inspection supports two reconstruction modes:

| Mode | Meaning | Required Behavior |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `strict` | No speculative fill | Missing retained state stays missing; no interpolation |
| `best_effort` | Bounded approximation allowed | Interpolation or gap-fill allowed, but MUST reduce confidence and emit warnings |

If omitted, `best_effort` is the default for operator ergonomics. Consumers that need exact retained state only should request `strict`.

### Incident-Centric Queries

Request state around incident boundaries:

```json
{
  "action": "inspect",
  "request_id": "req_20260322040000_x7k",
  "incident_replay": {
    "incident_ref": "incident:inc-20260322-abc",
    "boundary": "opened",
    "window_before_ms": 300000,
    "window_after_ms": 60000
  }
}
```

### Range Queries

Request events within a bounded time range:

```json
{
  "action": "inspect",
  "request_id": "req_20260322040000_x7k",
  "range": {
    "start": "2026-03-22T03:45:00Z",
    "end": "2026-03-22T04:00:00Z",
    "sections": ["attention"],
    "limit": 100
  }
}
```

## Supported Time Windows

### Retention Limits

| Data Type | Default Retention | Max Retention |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Projection snapshots | 1 hour | 24 hours |
| Attention events | 24 hours | 7 days |
| Incident state | 7 days | 30 days |
| Agent state changes | 6 hours | 24 hours |
| Pane output samples | 30 minutes | 2 hours |
| Quota readings | 1 hour | 6 hours |

### Window Boundaries

```json
{
  "historical_limits": {
    "as_of_max_age_ms": 86400000,
    "incident_replay_max_window_ms": 3600000,
    "range_query_max_span_ms": 900000,
    "output_sample_retention_ms": 1800000
  }
}
```

## Replay Targets

### Target Reference Types

| Reference | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Incident | `incident:<id>` | `incident:inc-20260322-abc` |
| Attention item | `attention:<fingerprint>` | `attention:fp-20260322040000` |
| Session | `session:<name>` | `session:main` |
| Agent | `agent:<name>` | `agent:PeachPond` |
| Alert | `alert:<id>` | `alert:alt-20260322-xyz` |

### Target Resolution

```json
{
  "replay_target": {
    "ref": "incident:inc-20260322-abc",
    "resolved": true,
    "resolution": {
      "type": "incident",
      "id": "inc-20260322-abc",
      "opened_at": "2026-03-22T03:45:00Z",
      "closed_at": "2026-03-22T04:15:00Z",
      "state_at_open": "available",
      "state_at_close": "available"
    }
  }
}
```

## Incident Replay

### Incident Boundaries

```
    window_before          incident           window_after
    ◄────────────────►◄───────────────────►◄───────────────►

    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────┐    ┌─────────┐
    │ CONTEXT │    │       INCIDENT          │    │ OUTCOME │
    │  STATE  │    │                         │    │  STATE  │
    └─────────┘    └─────────────────────────┘    └─────────┘
         ▲              ▲               ▲              ▲
      as_of:        opened_at      resolved_at     as_of:
    opened-5m                                    resolved+1m
```

Supported replay anchors:

| Boundary | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `opened` | Anchor on incident creation/open transition |
| `acknowledged` | Anchor on first explicit operator acknowledgement |
| `escalated` | Anchor on severity or routing escalation |
| `resolved` | Anchor on incident resolution transition |
| `closed` | Anchor on terminal closure, if distinct from resolved |

Normative rules:
1. `opened` is the default anchor when a boundary is omitted.
2. Replay windows are applied relative to the chosen anchor, not to the whole incident lifetime.
3. If the requested boundary never occurred, ntm MUST return a typed error such as `INCIDENT_BOUNDARY_UNAVAILABLE`.
4. Unresolved incidents MAY be replayed around `opened`, `acknowledged`, or `escalated`, but `resolved` and `closed` are unavailable until those transitions occur.
5. Incident replay MUST use stable incident references; display labels alone are insufficient.

    }
  }
}
```

## Reconstruction Methods

### Snapshot vs Event Replay

| Method | When Used | Accuracy | Performance |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Snapshot | Recent, cached | Exact | Fast |
| Event replay | Older, uncached | Reconstructed | Slower |
| Hybrid | Gap in snapshots | Best-effort | Variable |

### Reconstruction Metadata

```json
{
  "reconstruction": {
    "method": "event_replay",
    "source": "attention_journal",
    "events_replayed": 127,
    "gaps_detected": 0,
    "interpolations": 0,
    "started_at": "2026-03-22T04:00:00Z",
    "completed_at": "2026-03-22T04:00:00.500Z",
    "duration_ms": 500
  }
}
```

### Reconstruction Confidence

| Level | Meaning | Conditions |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `high` | Exact state known | Snapshot available or full event replay |
| `medium` | Mostly accurate | Minor gaps filled by interpolation |
| `low` | Approximate | Significant gaps or stale sources |
| `unavailable` | Cannot reconstruct | Data expired or corrupted |

## Staleness Reporting

### Staleness Metadata

```json
{
  "staleness": {
    "requested_at": "2026-03-22T03:50:00Z",
    "actual_at": "2026-03-22T03:50:00Z",
    "drift_ms": 0,
    "age_at_request_ms": 600000,
    "source_staleness": {
      "quota": {"stale": false, "age_ms": 5000},
      "alerts": {"stale": false, "age_ms": 2000},
      "agents": {"stale": true, "age_ms": 120000, "reason": "poll_failed"}
    },
    "confidence": "high",
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

### Staleness Warnings

| Warning | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `STALE_SOURCE` | One or more sources were stale at requested time |
| `RECONSTRUCTED` | State was reconstructed, not from snapshot |
| `INTERPOLATED` | Gaps filled by interpolation |
| `PARTIAL_DATA` | Some sections unavailable |
| `NEAR_RETENTION_EDGE` | Data near retention boundary |
| `POLICY_CHANGED` | Redaction policy changed since event time |

## Partial History

### Unavailable Data

{
  "partial_history": {
    "requested_sections": ["quota", "alerts", "agents", "panes"],
    "available_sections": ["quota", "alerts", "agents"],

      {
        "section": "panes",

```

### REST

```http
GET /api/robot/inspect?as_of=2026-03-22T03:50:00Z&sections=quota,alerts HTTP/1.1

GET /api/robot/incidents/inc-20260322-abc/replay HTTP/1.1

POST /api/robot/export HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "incident_ref": "incident:inc-20260322-abc",
  "format": "json"
}
```

## Contract Integration

### Identity Contract

Replay uses stable references:

```json
{
  "replay_target": {
    "ref": "incident:inc-20260322-abc",
    "resolved_via": "identity_registry"
  }
}
```

### Request Correlation Contract

Historical inspection participates in the same request-identity and correlation rules as live robot surfaces.

```json
{
  "correlation": {
    "request_id": "req_20260322040000_x7k",
    "parent_request_id": "req_20260322035955_root",
    "causal_ref": "incident:inc-20260322-abc"
  }
}
```

Normative rules:
1. Historical responses MUST echo the caller-provided `request_id`.
2. If historical inspection was triggered from another robot response, handoff, or alert, the response SHOULD preserve a `parent_request_id`.
3. `causal_ref` SHOULD identify the replay target or incident that caused the reconstruction run.

### Explainability Contract

Reconstruction includes explanation:

```json
{
  "explanation": {
    "type": "reconstruction",
    "short": "State reconstructed from event replay",
    "code": "EXPLAIN_RECONSTRUCTED",
    "evidence": {
      "method": "event_replay",
      "events_replayed": 127,
      "gaps": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Diagnostics Handle Contract

Expensive or degraded reconstruction runs SHOULD emit a stable diagnostics handle so agents can inspect the evidence trail without repeating the whole query.

```json
{
  "diagnostics": {
    "handle": "diag:hist:20260322:abc123",
    "kind": "historical_reconstruction",
    "evidence_refs": [
      "event:attn:9421",
      "incident:inc-20260322-abc",
      "watermark:attention:9388"
    ]
  }
}
```

Normative rules:
1. A diagnostics handle MUST refer to the specific reconstruction run, not just the incident in general.
2. Evidence references attached to historical inspection MUST resolve through the stable resource-reference contract.
3. Re-running the same query MAY produce a new diagnostics handle if the retained evidence set changed.

### Sensitivity Contract

Historical data respects current policy:

```json
{
  "sensitivity": {
    "policy_at_event": "v2.0",
    "policy_current": "v2.1",
    "retroactive_redactions": 2,
    "disclosure_note": "Additional patterns redacted by v2.1"
  }
}
```

### Boundedness Contract

Historical queries respect limits:

```json
{
  "boundedness": {
    "requested_range_ms": 900000,
    "allowed_range_ms": 900000,
    "events_requested": "unlimited",
    "events_limit": 1000,
    "truncated": false
  }
}
```

Additional boundedness rules:
1. Historical inspection MUST cap both time span and payload volume; support for recent history does not imply support for arbitrary long-range export.
2. Incident replay MUST bound `window_before_ms` and `window_after_ms` independently.
3. If a bounded response truncates events or evidence, the response MUST say so explicitly and include the applicable limit.

## Error Handling

### Historical Query Errors

| Code | Meaning | Recovery |
|------|---------|----------|
| `TIMESTAMP_TOO_OLD` | Requested time beyond retention | Query within limits |
| `INCIDENT_NOT_FOUND` | Incident reference invalid | Check incident ID |
| `INCIDENT_BOUNDARY_UNAVAILABLE` | Requested incident boundary never occurred | Choose an available boundary |
| `RECONSTRUCTION_FAILED` | Cannot rebuild state | Use partial data |
| `RANGE_TOO_WIDE` | Query span exceeds limit | Narrow range |
| `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` | Historical source missing | Accept partial |

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "TIMESTAMP_TOO_OLD",
    "message": "Requested timestamp 2026-03-21T00:00:00Z is beyond 24h retention limit",
    "requested_at": "2026-03-21T00:00:00Z",
    "oldest_available": "2026-03-21T04:00:00Z",
    "retention_limit_ms": 86400000,
    "suggestion": "Query for more recent timestamp"
  }
}
```

## Design Rationale

1. **Bounded, not unbounded**: Explicit retention limits prevent storage bloat
2. **Incident-centric**: Incidents are natural replay anchors for debugging
3. **Confidence-aware**: Always report reconstruction quality
4. **Retroactive policy**: Current sensitivity rules apply to history
5. **On-demand first**: Reconstruct when needed, cache for efficiency
6. **Graceful degradation**: Partial data better than no data
